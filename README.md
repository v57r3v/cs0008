ESE 419/572: Analog Integrated Circuits 
Semester:                         Fall   2024Topics: Analog   circuits   serve   as   the   interface   between   the   physical   and   digital   worlds.   Analog   circuits   amplify   and   digitize   sensor   signals   such   as   those   from   a   microphone,   accelerometer,   chemical   sensor   or   even   the   small   RF   signals   received   on   an   antenna.   Analog   circuits   also   turn   digital signals into analog outputs capable of driving   physical devices   such   as   antennas,   speakers,   and      robotic      motors.    Analog    circuits       often      define    the       limits       of    system       level      performance,   determining   the   smallest   signals   that   can   be   sensed,   the   largest   signals   that   can   be   produced,   and the overall efficiency of sensors,   radios, and   actuators.   In this   course you   will   learn   to   design   and   analyze   analog   integrated   circuits   using   both   hand   calculations   and   circuit   simulations.   We   will   focus   on   the   design   of   CMOS   analog   circuits   supplemented   with   material   pertaining   to   the   design   of   analog   circuits   using    FinFET   and    Bipolar   junction   transistors.   You   will    learn    how   to   design      and      analyze      single      and      multi-stage      amplifier    circuits       including    the    gain,      frequency   response,   stability,   noise,   and   linearity.   The   course   will   conclude   with   a   project   to   design   an   amplifier to a set of   provided   specifications.Background Knowledge and Prerequisites: It   is   assumed   students   have   basic   knowledge   of field   effect    and    bipolar   junction    transistors    and    in    analyzing    simple    passive    and    active    electronic   circuits   using   Kirkoff’s voltage and current   laws.

Lectures: 
Live   lectures   will   be   held   every   Monday   and   Wednesday   from   1:45-3:15   Eastern   Time   in   Fagin   Hall   Rm   114.   Lecture slides will   be   posted on Canvas   prior to   each   lecture.   The   lectures   from   Fall   of   2020   will   be   posted   on   Canvas   as   reference   and   study   material   only.   The   online   lectures   are   no substitute for the   in   person   lectures and should   be   used only   as   reference   material.   In   person   lecture attendance   is   highly encouraged. Some   materials   have   been   updated since   2020.
Class Rules: 
1.       Class   participation   is encouraged.      If you   have   a   question,   please   ask   it,   others   likely   have   the same   question.
2.         Do   not   disrupt   the   class.      Silence   all   cell   phones.      Do   not   do   other   activities   (e.g.   eating,   talking) that   may disrupt the ability of   other   students to   participate   in   the   lectures.
Grading: 
Your   grade   will   depend   on   homework   (15%), quizzes   (10%),a   midterm   exam   (20%),afinal   exam (35%), and a final   project   (20%).      Details are   given   below.
Homework: 
Throughout the semester a series of homework assignments will be   periodically assigned and will   be    due    at   the    beginning    of    class    approximately    2    weeks    after    assignment.       There    will    be    5   homework assignments throughout the semester. Working on   homework   in groups   is   permitted   but    each    student      should      turn       in    an       individual      homework    assignment.      Since       homework      is   preparation for the exams   please   be sure you   understand all   of the   homework   solutions   you   are   submitting.       Also,    be    sure      to   show   ALL   of   your   work   to    receive    partial   credit代 写ESE 419/572: Analog Integrated Circuits Fall 2024R
代做程序编程语言.   Submission   of   homework   should   be   in   pdf   format   through   Canvas.   Should   you   need   to   submit   an   assignment   late   due   to   illness   or   other   emergency   please   let   me   know   as   soon   as   possible   so   we   can   make   alternative arrangements.
